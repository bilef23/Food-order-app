**Subject: Internet technologies**

*Short description:*

*Utilizing the MVC pattern common to .NET applications, users can easily browse through a diverse selection of meals and add them to their shopping cart.
Each authenticated user is provided with a personalized shopping cart upon registration, allowing them to add multiple meals for convenient ordering.*

To enhance user experience, certain actions such as adding items to the shopping cart are handled asynchronously using AJAX requests, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions.

One unique feature of our application is the 'Random Meal' section, where users can discover new dishes by browsing through rotating images. Upon finding a meal of interest, users can stop the rotation and proceed to order it.

Additionally, the application includes an email feature, enabling users to send messages directly to the administrator. Implemented via an SMTP server, users can provide their name and message content, with emails sent exclusively to the administrator's inbox.  

Furthermore, it's important to note that the application isn't currently hosted, providing an opportunity for further refinement and potential deployment in the future.  For those interested in experiencing the application's interface, screenshots are available in the UI directory, providing insight into its design and functionality.
